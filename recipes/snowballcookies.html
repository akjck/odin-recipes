        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A favorite recipe of my grandma's. A shortbread-like cookie with chocolate chips. Perfect for a cold, Christmassy day.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, I could not remeber the exact recipe so this one is from cookingclassy.com.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup sliced almonds</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour </li>
            <li>3/8 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups powdered sugar (can substitute with regular sugar)</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup (or more) chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Grind almonds in a food processor to tiny bits. In a mixing bowl whisk together flour and salt.</li>
            <li>Cream together butter and 1/2 cup powdered sugar until combined, just blended and slightly creamy.</li>
            <li>Mix in vanilla, then with mixer set on low speed slowly add in flour and salt mixture and mix just until combined.</li>
            <li>Add in chocolate chips and almonds and mix to evenly distribute.</li>
            <li>Scoop dough out 1 Tbsp at a time and roll into a ball. Transfer dough balls to an ungreased cookie sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven 10 - 12 minutes until bottoms are lightly golden brown. Let cool for just a few minutes, then pour remaining 1 cup powdered sugar into a small mixing bowl.</li>
            <li>Dip and roll cookies in powdered sugar to get a light coating then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            <li>Once cookies are cool roll again in powdered sugar, this time giving them a thicker coating. Store cookies in an airtight container.</li>
        </ol>
